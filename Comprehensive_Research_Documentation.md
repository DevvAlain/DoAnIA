# IoT MQTT Security Research Platform - Comprehensive Academic Documentation

## 1.3. Research Objectives

This project aims to design and implement an open-source, rule-based detection and monitoring system for the MQTT protocol to be deployed alongside brokers. By finding and using public MQTT datasets as a base, the group can identify the important fields for creating detection rules against popular MQTT attacks (such as DDoS or flood attacks), and simulate traffic to be as close to their real-life counterparts as possible for testing the detection system.

### 1.3.1 Primary Research Goals

**Comprehensive MQTT Security Framework Development:**
Our research establishes a multi-layered security framework specifically designed for MQTT-enabled IoT networks, addressing the critical gaps identified in current literature. Recent studies by Ullah et al. (2023) demonstrate that existing ML-based IoT-IDS face significant limitations in effectively detecting malicious activities, primarily due to imbalanced training data and computational overhead unsuitable for resource-constrained environments.

**Rule-Based Detection System Architecture:**
Unlike computationally intensive machine learning approaches that achieve 99.9% accuracy but require substantial resources (as demonstrated in transformer neural network-based systems), our rule-based approach prioritizes interpretability, lightweight deployment, and real-time performance. This aligns with Industry 4.0 requirements for smart factories where IoT devices must operate under strict resource constraints while maintaining high security standards.

**Canonical Dataset Integration and Standardization:**
Building upon the MQTT-IoT-IDS2020 dataset foundation, our system processes 2.5+ million records from 9 heterogeneous IoT device types into a unified canonical schema with 60-70% field standardization. This addresses the critical challenge of dataset fragmentation identified in recent Industrial IoT surveys, where interoperability and data consistency remain primary barriers to widespread IDS deployment.

### 1.3.2 Technical Implementation Objectives

**Real-Time Attack Detection Capabilities:**
The system implements nine distinct MQTT attack patterns based on comprehensive threat modeling:

1. **Message Flooding Attacks**: Detection of abnormal publish rates exceeding baseline thresholds
2. **Wildcard Subscription Abuse**: Identification of malicious topic filter exploitation
3. **Topic Brute-Force Attacks**: Recognition of systematic topic enumeration attempts
4. **Payload Anomaly Injection**: Detection of malformed or suspicious message payloads
5. **Retain/QoS Abuse**: Identification of protocol feature exploitation
6. **Client ID Conflict Attacks**: Detection of identity spoofing attempts
7. **Reconnection Storm Patterns**: Recognition of DoS through connection flooding
8. **QoS 2 Delivery Abuse**: Detection of exactly-once delivery mechanism exploitation
9. **Authentication Bypass Attempts**: Identification of credential-based attacks

**IoT Traffic Simulation Framework:**
Our dual-mode simulator architecture provides:

- **Enhanced Mode**: Realistic IoT payload generation with proper JSON formatting and device-specific telemetry patterns
- **Canonical Mode**: Historical data replay from standardized dataset ensuring reproducible testing scenarios

### 1.3.3 Performance and Scalability Targets

**Quantifiable System Performance Metrics:**
The system is designed to handle monitoring for approximately 300 MQTT clients with the following performance objectives:

- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: ≥ 90% for attack detection accuracy
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: ≤ 5% to minimize operational overhead
- **Processing Latency (p95)**: ≤ 300ms for near real-time response
- **Additional CPU Usage**: ≤ 30% above idle state
- **Additional RAM Usage**: ≤ 400MB above idle state

These metrics represent a significant improvement over existing solutions, where transformer-based systems achieve higher accuracy but at the cost of substantial computational overhead inappropriate for SME environments.

### 1.3.4 Deployment and Integration Goals

**Containerized Monitoring Pipeline:**
The complete monitoring–detection pipeline (Rule Engine → EMQX → Fluent Bit/Telegraf → InfluxDB → Grafana) is packaged as a containerized application using Docker Compose. This addresses deployment complexity challenges identified in recent Industrial IoT implementation studies, where system integration remains a primary barrier to adoption.

**Real-Time Dashboard Integration:**
The system incorporates a Grafana-based real-time dashboard for monitoring, providing:

- Live attack detection alerts and incident response
- Performance metrics visualization and trending
- Historical analysis capabilities for threat intelligence
- System health monitoring and resource utilization tracking

## 1.4. Significance of the Study

### 1.4.1 SME Practical Implications

This research provides a lightweight, interpretable, and reproducible MQTT attack monitoring and detection system specifically designed for small- and medium-scale enterprise (SME) IoT environments where resources are tight and administrators may not have advanced security knowledge.

**Resource-Efficient Security for Constrained Environments:**
Recent surveys on Industrial IoT implementations highlight that while advanced machine learning solutions achieve high accuracy rates (up to 99.9% as demonstrated by transformer neural networks), they impose significant computational burdens unsuitable for SME environments. Our rule-based approach addresses this critical gap by providing effective security monitoring within the resource constraints typical of SME IoT deployments.

**Interpretable Security Decision Making:**
Unlike black-box machine learning approaches, our rule-based detection system provides clear, interpretable results that enable SME administrators to understand, validate, and act upon security alerts. This transparency is crucial in environments where security teams may lack deep machine learning expertise but require actionable intelligence for incident response.

**Cost-Effective Implementation:**
While intrusion detection systems or advanced machine learning plans impose resource burdens and are frequently expensive to install and maintain, the rule-based approach enables real-time recognition of typical MQTT abuses (e.g., publish flooding, wildcard abuses, brute-force authentication, client takeover, and payload anomalies), thereby reducing investigation time and maximizing response effectiveness.

### 1.4.2 Portability and Deployment Ease

**Containerized Architecture for Multi-Environment Deployment:**
The entire monitoring–detection pipeline (Rule Engine → EMQX → Fluent Bit/Telegraf → InfluxDB → Grafana) is packaged as a containerized application using Docker Compose, thus simplifying deployment, scaling, and redeployment across different environments (pilot projects, laboratories, production). This significantly reduces the time between deployability and research prototypes.

**Industry 4.0 Integration Readiness:**
Our containerized approach aligns with Industry 4.0 smart factory requirements identified in recent literature, where IoT systems must seamlessly integrate with existing industrial infrastructure while maintaining operational continuity. The Docker Compose architecture enables rapid deployment across heterogeneous environments without requiring extensive system-specific configuration.

**Scalable Monitoring Infrastructure:**
The modular architecture supports horizontal scaling to accommodate growing IoT deployments, addressing the scalability challenges identified in Industrial IoT surveys where system growth often necessitates complete infrastructure redesign.

### 1.4.3 Standardization of MQTT Logging

**Unified Schema for Heterogeneous Data Sources:**
Through conceptualization of one common schema across disparate datasets (~60–70% overlap of fields standardized), our work reduces analysis errors, facilitates uniform queries, and ensures experimental reproducibility. This standardized log format also offers prerequisites for future extensions to machine learning and cross-dataset comparisons without difficulty.

**Data Quality and Consistency Assurance:**
Our canonical dataset processing pipeline addresses critical data quality issues identified in IoT security research:

- **Payload Sanitization**: Hex decoding and format validation ensuring clean data ingestion
- **Field Mapping**: Automatic detection and standardization of 60+ field name variants across different data sources
- **Schema Validation**: Consistent data types and formats across all processed records
- **Temporal Normalization**: Standardized timestamp formats enabling accurate temporal analysis

**Research Reproducibility Enhancement:**
The standardized dataset format enables reproducible research across different studies and institutions, addressing a critical gap in IoT security research where dataset heterogeneity often prevents meaningful comparison of results across studies.

### 1.4.4 Quantifiable Goals for System Performance

**Evidence-Based Performance Metrics:**
The project defines clear quality metrics for near-real-time detection for a system of 300 devices: True Positive Rate (TPR) ≥ 90%, False Positive Rate (FPR) ≤ 5%, 95th percentile latency ≤ 300 ms, additional CPU usage ≤ 30%, and additional RAM usage ≤ 400 MB above idle. These quantifiable metrics both promote practical measurability for SMEs and comparability for subsequent studies.

**Benchmark Comparison with State-of-the-Art:**
